This solution uses a class for the collection of widgets:
By making our own class with the responsibility to know how we handle having multiple widgets we cure
a primitive obsession waiting to happen.

Then we extend this widget list class with a sort() method that has the responsibility of sorting the widgets.
It is this method that has the responsibility of knowing that sorting should be done using a Schwartzian transform
to reduce the number of calls to the expensive method.
