# CodeDiscussions

Hello and welcome to CodeDiscussions!

If you are here from Systematic follow us on Yammer.

You should be able to run the code anywhere in this project using intelliJ
with the provided .iml files. You can also open a specific language or
even a specific challenge as a project, and play around with the code.

Each challenge will contain a README.md with the initial challenge text,
and a commit hash you can check out if you want to work on the challenge at your own pace.
